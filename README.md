##  THEORY

Electromagnetism is a fundamental branch of physics that deals with the interaction of *electric charges, currents, electric fields, and magnetic fields*.  
The entire classical theory of electromagnetism is unified through *Maxwell’s equations*, which explain how electric and magnetic fields are generated and how they propagate through space as electromagnetic waves.

This library implements the major laws of electromagnetism numerically to help students and researchers *understand physical behavior through computation*.


## (1️) Coulomb’s Law

Coulomb’s Law describes the *electrostatic force* between two stationary point charges.

### Mathematical Form
F = (1 / 4πϵ₀) × (q₁ q₂ / r²)
---
### Physical Interpretation
- Force is directly proportional to the product of charges  
- Force is inversely proportional to the square of distance  
- Like charges repel, unlike charges attract
-  
---
### Computational Approach
The force is computed numerically for varying distances, and the inverse-square nature is verified through graphical plots.

---

## (2) Gauss’s Law (Electric)

Gauss’s Law relates the *electric flux* through a closed surface to the *total charge enclosed*.

### Mathematical Form
∮ E · dA = Q / ϵ₀
---
### Physical Interpretation
- Electric flux depends only on enclosed charge  
- Independent of the shape of the Gaussian surface  
- Demonstrates symmetry in electric fields  

### Computational Approach
Electric flux is computed numerically for different charge values and visualized to verify linear proportionality.

---

## (3️) Biot–Savart Law

The Biot–Savart Law describes the *magnetic field produced by a steady electric current*.

### Mathematical Form (Straight Current-Carrying Wire)
B = (μ₀ I) / (2π r)
---
### Physical Interpretation
- Magnetic field strength decreases with distance  
- Direction is determined by the right-hand thumb rule  

### Computational Approach
Magnetic field values are calculated for different distances and plotted to demonstrate magnetic field decay.

## 4️⃣ Maxwell’s Equations

Maxwell’s equations unify electricity and magnetism and predict the existence of *electromagnetic waves*.

### Differential Form
∇ · E = ρ / ϵ₀        (Gauss’s Law – Electric) 
∇ · B = 0            (Gauss’s Law – Magnetism) 
∇ × E = −∂B/∂t       (Faraday’s Law) 
∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ϵ₀∂E/∂t (Ampère–Maxwell Law)
