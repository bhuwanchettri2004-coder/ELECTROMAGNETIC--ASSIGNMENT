# ⚡ Electromagnetic Theory Library (C++)

A comprehensive *C++ Electromagnetic Theory library* that numerically implements the *fundamental laws of electromagnetism* and visualizes their physical behavior using graphical plots.  
This project bridges *theoretical electromagnetism* with *computational physics*.


## 🎯 AIM

The aim of this project is to design and develop a modular *Electromagnetic Theory library in C++* that numerically implements the fundamental laws of electromagnetism—*Coulomb’s Law, Gauss’s Law, Biot–Savart Law, and Maxwell’s Equations (1D, 2D, and 3D)*—and to visualize their behavior through computational simulations and graphs.


##  FEATURES

✔ Modular C++ library design  
✔ Numerical implementation of EM laws  
✔ 1D, 2D, and 3D Maxwell equation solvers  
✔ Graphical visualization using *gnuplot*  
✔ Clean, academic, and extendable structure  


##  THEORY

Electromagnetism is a fundamental branch of physics that deals with the interaction of *electric charges, currents, electric fields, and magnetic fields*.  
The entire classical theory of electromagnetism is unified through *Maxwell’s equations*, which explain how electric and magnetic fields are generated and how they propagate through space as electromagnetic waves.

This library implements the major laws of electromagnetism numerically to help students and researchers *understand physical behavior through computation*.


## (1️) Coulomb’s Law

Coulomb’s Law describes the *electrostatic force* between two stationary point charges.

### Mathematical Form
F = (1 / 4πϵ₀) × (q₁ q₂ / r²)
### Physical Interpretation
- Force is directly proportional to the product of charges  
- Force is inversely proportional to the square of distance  
- Like charges repel, unlike charges attract  

### Computational Approach
The force is computed numerically for varying distances, and the inverse-square nature is verified through graphical plots.

## (2) Gauss’s Law (Electric)

Gauss’s Law relates the *electric flux* through a closed surface to the *total charge enclosed*.

### Mathematical Form
